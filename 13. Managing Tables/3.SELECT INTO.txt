SELECT INTO statement creates a new table and inserts data returned from a query into the table.

Unlike a regular SELECT statement, the SELECT INTO statement does not return a result to the client.

statement creates a new table called film_r that contains films with the rating R and rental duration 5 days from the film table.

SELECT
    film_id,
    title,
    rental_rate
INTO TABLE film_r
FROM
    film
WHERE
    rating = 'R'
AND rental_duration = 5
ORDER BY
    title;
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
To verify the table creation, you can query data from the film_r table:

SELECT * FROM film_r;

The CREATE TABLE AS statement creates a new table and fills it with the data returned by a query

//Example
CREATE TABLE action_film AS
SELECT
    film_id,
    title,
    release_year,
    length,
    rating
FROM
    film
INNER JOIN film_category USING (film_id)
WHERE
    category_id = 1;


//To verify the table creation, you can query data from the action_film table:
SELECT * FROM action_film
ORDER BY title;

To check the structure of the action_film, you can use the following command in the psql tool:

\d action_film;

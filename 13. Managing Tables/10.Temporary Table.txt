A temporary table, as its named implied, is a short-lived table that exists for the duration of a database session. PostgreSQL automatically drops the temporary tables at the end of a session or a transaction.

create a temporary table named mytemp as follows:

test=# CREATE TEMP TABLE mytemp(c INT);
CREATE TABLE
test=# SELECT * FROM mytemp;

Then, launch another session that connects to the test database and query data from the mytemp table:

test=# SELECT * FROM mytemp;
ERROR:  relation "mytemp" does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT * FROM mytemp;

//After that, quit all the sessions:

test=# \q

//Removing a PostgreSQL temporary table
DROP TABLE temp_table_name;

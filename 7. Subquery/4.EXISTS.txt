EXISTS operator to test for existence of rows in a subquery.

//Find customers who have at least one payment whose amount is greater than 11

SELECT first_name,
       last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE EXISTS
    (SELECT 1
     FROM payment p
     WHERE p.customer_id = c.customer_id
       AND amount > 11 )
ORDER BY first_name,
         last_name;

In this example, for each customer in the customer table, the subquery checks the payment table to find if that customer made at least one payment (p.customer_id = c.customer_id) and the amount is greater than 11 ( amount > 11)

The PostgreSQL ANY operator compares a value to a set of values returned by a subquery. The following illustrates the syntax of  the ANY operator

expresion operator ANY(subquery)

The ANY operator must be preceded by one of the following comparison operator =, <=, >, <, > and <>

You can use this query as a subquery in the following statement that finds the films whose lengths are greater than or equal to the maximum length of any film category :

The ANY and ALL operators are used with a WHERE or HAVING clause.

The ANY operator returns true if any of the subquery values meet the condition.


SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE length >= ANY(
    SELECT MAX( length )
    FROM film
    INNER JOIN film_category USING(film_id)
    GROUP BY  category_id );


ANY vs. IN
The = ANY is equivalent to IN operator.

The following example gets the film whose category is either Action or Drama.

SELECT
    title,
    category_id
FROM
    film
INNER JOIN film_category
        USING(film_id)
WHERE
    category_id = ANY(
        SELECT
            category_id
        FROM
            category
        WHERE
            NAME = 'Action'
            OR NAME = 'Drama'
    );

The following statement uses the IN operator which produces the same result:

SELECT
    title,
    category_id
FROM
    film
INNER JOIN film_category
        USING(film_id)
WHERE
    category_id IN(
        SELECT
            category_id
        FROM
            category
        WHERE
            NAME = 'Action'
            OR NAME = 'Drama'
    );

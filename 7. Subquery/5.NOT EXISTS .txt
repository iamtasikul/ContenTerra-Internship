The NOT operator negates the result of the EXISTS operator. The NOT EXISTS is opposite to EXISTS. It means that if the subquery returns no row, the NOT EXISTS returns true. If the subquery returns one or more rows, the NOT EXISTS returns false.

The following example returns customers have not made any payment that greater than 11.

SELECT first_name,
       last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE NOT EXISTS
    (SELECT 1
     FROM payment p
     WHERE p.customer_id = c.customer_id
       AND amount > 11 )
ORDER BY first_name,
         last_name;

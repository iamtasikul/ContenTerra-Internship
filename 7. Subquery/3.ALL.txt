The ALL operator returns TRUE if all of the subquery values meet the condition.

The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the product names if ALL the records in the OrderDetails table has quantity = 10 (so, this example will return FALSE, because not ALL records in the OrderDetails table has quantity = 10):

SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ALL (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);

find all films whose lengths are greater than the list of the average lengths above, you use the ALL and greater than operator (>) as follows:

SELECT
    film_id,
    title,
    length
FROM
    film
WHERE
    length > ALL (
            SELECT
                ROUND(AVG (length),2)
            FROM
                film
            GROUP BY
                rating
    )
ORDER BY
    length;

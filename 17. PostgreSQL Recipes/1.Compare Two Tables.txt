//compare using EXCEPT
We used EXCEPT operator that returns the rows in the foo table but not in the bar table. We can apply the same technique to find the rows that are in the bar table but not in the foo table.

SELECT
	ID,
	NAME,
	'not in bar' AS note
FROM
	foo
EXCEPT
	SELECT
		ID,
		NAME,
		'not in bar' AS note
	FROM
		bar

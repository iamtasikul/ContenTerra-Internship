integer types: SMALLINT, INTEGER, and BIGINT.

CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
    pages SMALLINT NOT NULL CHECK (pages > 0)
);

CREATE TABLE cities (
    city_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    city_name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
    population INT NOT NULL CHECK (population >= 0) --stores large data
);

Using BIGINT type is not only consuming a lot of storage but also decreasing the performance of the database, therefore, you should have a good reason to use it.

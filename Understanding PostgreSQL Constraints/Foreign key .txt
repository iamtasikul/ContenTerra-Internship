A foreign key is a column or a group of columns in a table that reference the primary key of another table.

PostgreSQL supports the following actions:

SET NULL
SET DEFAULT
RESTRICT
NO ACTION
CASCADE

//The RESTRICT action is similar to the NO ACTION.
//SET NULL
The SET NULL automatically sets NULL to the foreign key columns in the referencing rows of the child table when the referenced rows in the parent table are deleted.
//CASCADE
The ON DELETE CASCADE automatically deletes all the referencing rows in the child table when the referenced rows in the parent table are deleted. I

//create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
CREATE TABLE customers(
   customer_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY(customer_id)
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS contacts;
CREATE TABLE contacts(
   contact_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   customer_id INT,
   contact_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   phone VARCHAR(15),
   email VARCHAR(100),
   PRIMARY KEY(contact_id),
   CONSTRAINT fk_customer
      FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) 
	  REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
	  //ON DELETE SET NULL
          //ON DELETE CASCADE
	  //[ON UPDATE update_action (is not often used in practice. )]
);

//IN --alternative of OR
You use IN operator in the WHERE clause to check if a value matches any value in a list of values.

select * from students where lname in('Islam','Biswas') AND age>=20;
select * from students where age in (19,21,22);
select * from students where lname in('Islam','Biswas','Doe');

The following query uses the equal (=) and OR operators instead of the IN operator. 

//using OR
//OR (execute when any one or both Condition is true)
select * from students where lname='Islam' OR age>=20;
select * from students where age = 19 OR age = 21 OR age = 22;
select * from students where (lname='Islam' OR lname='Biswas') AND age>=20;

//IN with a subquery

SELECT customer_id,first_name,last_name FROM customer WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM rental WHERE CAST (return_date AS DATE) = '2005-05-27') ORDER BY customer_id;

Note that The CAST() function converts a value (of any type) into a specified datatype.

Example
Convert a value to an int datatype:

SELECT CAST(25.65 AS int);

=============WHERE Clause  (Use For Condition)================
WHERE clause, you use comparison and logical operators:

Operator	Description
=	Equal
>	Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater than or equal
<=	Less than or equal
<> or !=	Not equal
AND	Logical operator AND
OR	Logical operator OR
IN	Return true if a value matches any value in a list
BETWEEN	Return true if a value is between a range of values
LIKE	Return true if a value matches a pattern
IS NULL	Return true if a value is NULL
NOT	Negate the result of other operators

============//Example\\====================
select * from students where age>=30;

//WHERE clause with the AND operator 
select * from students where lname='Islam' AND age>=20;

//WHERE clause with the OR operator
select * from students where lname='Islam' OR age>=20;

//WHERE clause with the IN operator 
select * from students where lname in('Islam','Biswas','Doe');

//WHERE clause with the LIKE operator
select * from students where lname like 'I%';

The % is called a wildcard that matches any string. The 'I%' pattern matches any string that starts with 'I'.

//WHERE clause with the BETWEEN operator
SELECT fname,LENGTH(fname) name_length FROM students WHERE fname LIKE 'I%' AND LENGTH(fname) BETWEEN 3 AND 5 ORDER BY name_length;

The BETWEEN operator returns true if a value is in a range of values.

In this example, we used the LENGTH() function gets the number of characters of an input string.

//WHERE clause with the not equal operator (<>) 

SELECT fname, lname FROM students WHERE fname LIKE 'I%' AND lname <> 'Biswas';

Note that you can use the != operator and <> operator interchangeably because they are equivalent.

//NOT IN
select * from students where age not in (19,21,22)
select * from students where not (age=19 or age=21 or age=22) --alternate

Similar to the IN operator, you can use the not equal (<>) and AND operators to write the NOT IN operator:

select * from students where age <> 19 AND age <> 21 AND age <> 22;

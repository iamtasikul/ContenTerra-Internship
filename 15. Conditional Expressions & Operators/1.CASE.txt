The PostgreSQL CASE expression is the same as IF/ELSE statement in other programming languages. It allows you to add if-else logic to the query to form a powerful query.

Since CASE is an expression, you can use it in any places where an expression can be used e.g.,SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause.

//CASE Example
SELECT title,
       length,
       CASE
           WHEN length> 0
                AND length <= 50 THEN 'Short'
           WHEN length > 50
                AND length <= 120 THEN 'Medium'
           WHEN length> 120 THEN 'Long'
       END duration
FROM film
ORDER BY title;

Note that we placed a column alias duration after the CASE expression.

//Case with aggregate function
SELECT
	SUM (CASE
               WHEN rental_rate = 0.99 THEN 1
	       ELSE 0
	      END
	) AS "Economy",
	SUM (
		CASE
		WHEN rental_rate = 2.99 THEN 1
		ELSE 0
		END
	) AS "Mass",
	SUM (
		CASE
		WHEN rental_rate = 4.99 THEN 1
		ELSE 0
		END
	) AS "Premium"
FROM
	film;

In this example, we used the CASE expression to return 1 or 0 if the rental rate falls into each price segment. And we applied the SUM function to calculate the total of films for each price segment.

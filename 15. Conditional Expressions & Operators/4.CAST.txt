There are many cases that you want to convert a value of one data type into another. PostgreSQL provides you with the CAST operator that allows you to do this.

//Syntax
CAST ( expression AS target_type );

//Cast a string to an integer example

SELECT CAST ('100' AS INTEGER);

// Cast a string to a date

SELECT
   CAST ('2015-01-01' AS DATE),
   CAST ('01-OCT-2015' AS DATE);

//Cast a string to a double
SELECT
   CAST ('10.2' AS DOUBLE PRECISION);

//Cast a string to a boolean
SELECT 
   CAST('true' AS BOOLEAN),
   CAST('false' as BOOLEAN),
   CAST('T' as BOOLEAN),
   CAST('F' as BOOLEAN);

// Convert a string to a timestamp
SELECT '2019-06-15 14:30:20'::timestamp;

// Convert a string to an interval

SELECT '15 minute'::interval,
 '2 hour'::interval,
 '1 day'::interval,
 '2 week'::interval,
 '3 month'::interval;

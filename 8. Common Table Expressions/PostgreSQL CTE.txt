A common table expression is a temporary result set which you can reference within another SQL statement including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE.

Common Table Expressions are temporary in the sense that they only exist during the execution of the query.

The following shows the syntax of creating a CTE:

WITH cte_name (column_list) AS (
    CTE_query_definition 
)
statement;


//Joining a CTE with a table example

WITH cte_rental AS (
    SELECT staff_id,
        COUNT(rental_id) rental_count
    FROM   rental
    GROUP  BY staff_id
)
SELECT s.staff_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    rental_count
FROM staff s
    INNER JOIN cte_rental USING (staff_id);

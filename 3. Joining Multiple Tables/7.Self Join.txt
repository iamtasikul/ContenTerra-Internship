A self-join is a regular join that joins a table to itself. In practice, you typically use a self-join to query hierarchical data or to compare rows within the same table.

//Querying hierarchical data 

CREATE TABLE employee (
	employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
	last_name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
	manager_id INT,
	FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) 
	REFERENCES employee (employee_id) 
	ON DELETE CASCADE
);
INSERT INTO employee (
	employee_id,
	first_name,
	last_name,
	manager_id
)
VALUES
	(1, 'Windy', 'Hays', NULL),
	(2, 'Ava', 'Christensen', 1),
	(3, 'Hassan', 'Conner', 1),
	(4, 'Anna', 'Reeves', 2),
	(5, 'Sau', 'Norman', 2),
	(6, 'Kelsie', 'Hays', 3),
	(7, 'Tory', 'Goff', 3),
	(8, 'Salley', 'Lester', 3);

//query uses the self-join to find who reports to whom

SELECT
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name employee,
    m .first_name || ' ' || m .last_name manager
FROM
    employee e
LEFT JOIN employee m ON m .employee_id = e.manager_id
ORDER BY manager;

//left join clause to join the basket_a table with the basket_b table. In the left join context, the first table is called the left table and the second table is called the right table.

Note that the LEFT JOIN is the same as the LEFT OUTER JOIN so you can use them interchangeably.

//Using Left Join

SELECT
    a,
    fruit_a,
    b,
    fruit_b
FROM
    basket_a
LEFT JOIN basket_b 
   ON fruit_a = fruit_b;

//To select rows from the left table that do not have matching rows in the right table, you use the left join with a WHERE clause. 

SELECT
    a,
    fruit_a,
    b,
    fruit_b
FROM
    basket_a
LEFT JOIN basket_b 
    ON fruit_a = fruit_b
WHERE b IS NULL;
